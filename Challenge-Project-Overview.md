## 📋 BTT Internal Evaluation Notes
*(This section is for BTT staff and CAs only — remove before sharing with students)*

### Technical Vetting
| Check | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Python Compatibility | 🟢 | Project utilizes standard libraries (HuggingFace transformers, scikit-learn, pandas) compatible with free-tier Google Colab environments. |
| Data Readiness | 🟡 | CUAD dataset is well-structured but requires significant effort to parse raw PDF text and align token-level labels for 41 categories, which may consume excessive time during early weeks. |
| Resource Check | 🟢 | Project fits within memory constraints; however, fine-tuning large transformer models will require careful batch size management in Colab. |

### Internal Scores
- **Student Fit Score:** 7/10
- **Technical Depth Score:** 8/10
- **Overall Recommendation:** REVISE

### Advisor Feedback Draft
The CUAD-based contract triage pipeline is a high-value industrial use case with excellent potential for technical rigor. To ensure success within the timeframe of the program, I suggest: (i) pivoting from fine-tuning from scratch to utilizing pre-trained lightweight models (e.g., DistilRoBERTa) to reduce hardware overhead demand; and (ii) constraining the scope by focusing on the 10 most impactful clause categories, and having the full 41 as a stretch goal.

## 🎯 The Challenge
### Project Summary
In this project, you will use real-world commercial contracts from the CUAD dataset (510 contracts, 41 expert-annotated clause categories) and NLP techniques including chunk-based multi-label classification with fine-tuned transformer encoders, paired with an explainable rule-based risk-scoring layer, to build a pipeline that automatically detects key clauses, flags them as Low/Medium/High risk, and rolls these up into a contract-level triage score. The team will fine-tune a pre-trained lightweight transformer encoder (e.g., DistilRoBERTa) rather than training a model from scratch, and will focus initial clause detection on the 10 most impactful clause categories, with full coverage of all 41 CUAD categories as a stretch goal. This will help our company address the bottleneck legal and procurement teams face when manually reviewing tens of thousands of contracts a year to find the small number of clauses that carry meaningful risk, enabling reviewers to prioritize which contracts to open first.

### Success Criteria
Success has two tracks:
- For clause detection: per-category precision/recall/F1 clearly beating the baseline (accuracy is misleading under CUAD's imbalance), with error analysis on where the model struggles.   
- For risk scoring: since there are no ground-truth labels, success means strong Spearman correlation and bucket agreement between the model's risk rankings and the advisor's hand-ranked clauses, plus a sensitivity analysis showing the High/Medium boundary is stable.

Overall, a successful December outcome is a working end-to-end pipeline producing risk-scored clause registers the advisor finds plausible and useful, a clean documented repo, and a final report covering results, limitations, and estimated reviewer time saved — an auditable triage tool the advisor would actually trust, not a black box.

### Stretch Goals
Stretch goals include span extraction, a trained risk model benchmarked against the rule-based baseline, LLM-generated clause explanations, broader category coverage, a Streamlit/Gradio demo, and an active-learning loop using advisor/model disagreements. These extend modeling or usability without affecting core deliverables.

### Project Milestones
Use these milestones to guide your work. Your team will create a GitHub Projects board to track tasks within each milestone.
| Month | Milestone | Key Activities |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| **September** | [Title] | Clean and split the CUAD data, run EDA on class imbalance, build a chunking strategy, and establish a TF-IDF/keyword baseline with per-category metrics. |
| **October** | [Title] | Fine-tune a transformer encoder for multi-label clause classification, address class imbalance, evaluate with per-category precision/recall/F1, and conduct error analysis. |
| **November** | [Title] | Build and calibrate the four-signal risk-scoring layer, assemble the end-to-end pipeline, and validate risk rankings against advisor-labeled examples. |

> **Note for the team:** Please create a GitHub Projects board in this repository to break these milestones into weekly tasks. Go to the **Projects** tab → **New project** → Choose **Board** → Add columns for each month.

### Key Details
- Real-world commercial contracts from the CUAD dataset (510 contracts, 41 expert-annotated clause categories), raw text/PDF available.
- Teams must implement strict preprocessing rules to handle document length variance and ensure text cleaning captures the necessary legal terminology for high-accuracy classification.
- Initial clause detection is scoped to the 10 categories below, with full coverage as a stretch goal.

### Focus Categories
| Category | Contracts (of 510) | Share |
|---|---|---|
| Governing Law | 437 | 85.7% |
| Anti-Assignment | 374 | 73.3% |
| Cap On Liability | 275 | 53.9% |
| License Grant | 255 | 50.0% |
